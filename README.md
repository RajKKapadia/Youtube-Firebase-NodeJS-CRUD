# Firebase NodeJS CRUD Example
Hello everyone, here is a simple example of CRUD operation on Firebase database using NodeJS. In order to replicate this work, you will need the following things:
* Firebase and GCP account, you can create one  for [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and for [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/), then create a GCP project, and add that same project in Firebase.
* Get GCP service account credentials for the project, you can learn more on it [here](https://youtu.be/ocUZgSUO-4I).
* NodeJS installed on your system

#### Youtube
A video explaining this is available [here]().

#### Running the APIs
* Once you have all the things mentioned above, you can run the following command to get all the required packages.
```javascript
npm install --save
```
* Inside `helper/firebase_api.js` file, provide the path of your service account credentials json file
* Run the command, you can listen to the APIs on [localhost](http://localhost:5000/).
```javascript
npm start
```

#### APIs
An API collection is in the repository, you can import that on your [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) application as well.
